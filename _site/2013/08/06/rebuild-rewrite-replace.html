					<p><em>This is an open letter to businessmen everywhere. It is written with love, and the hopes that you will better understand your developers.</em></p>

<p>Businessmen and developers alike will tell you it isn’t worth it to rewrite your codebase, even if just small portions of it.  It isn’t cost effective, it wastes time, and basically our skills are better used to create new and better features to beat out our competitors.  These are all valid points.  But what if your codebase is unintelligible?  What if your database is a tangled web of lies and confusion?</p>

<h4 id="developers-know-whats-best">Developers Know What’s Best</h4>

<p>Rebuilding your codebase can have extreme benefits to the business, but it’s difficult to convince the decision makers of this.  It’s shortsighted to believe that developers don’t understand the business side of things.  You hired your team. <strong>Trust them</strong> to understand what is best in all aspects of their department.  If it’s taking extra time and resources to build a seemingly simple feature, perhaps some things need to be assessed. <strong>The business will save money and resources in the long run by investing in a rewrite now.</strong></p>

<h4 id="data-integrity">Data Integrity</h4>

<p>Can you trust your database?  If the answer is “no”, you need to fix it immediately.  Pause development if you must. If the answer is “I don’t know” you need to ask your engineers. Chances are you’ll get a “no”.  Data integrity is an extremely serious matter both for your business, your engineers, and your users.  You’re wasting money constantly solving problems with data that could be solved permanently with a database refactoring. Data can be migrated to a new schema and features can be implemented faster. <strong>You’ll save time, money, and your development team’s sanity.</strong></p>

<h4 id="what-is-x-for-what-does-y-do">“What is X for? What does Y do?”</h4>

<p>If you’re team is asking each other this on a regular basis, there are problems.  Questions like this usually come from a feature being implemented too quickly or in a hacked together manner.  Get it done right, and prevent these questions later on.  Never run into your dev room and say something needs to get done “right now” or you will have problems down the road. Product and defect back logs are your friends. <strong>Use them and never rush a feature again.</strong></p>

<h4 id="wrap-it-up-mark">Wrap It Up, Mark</h4>

<p>It’s important to make sure your data makes sense. If it doesn’t, then what’s the point of storing it?  Likewise, it’s important to make sure your code makes sense as it speeds development in the future for new employees. Remember, your current development team will most likely phase out eventually.  Don’t make the job harder for the wonderful people inheriting their code.</p>

I’d love to hear from you.</p>
