<p><em>A Retrospective of the Last Four Years of my Life</em></p>

<p>Around this time four years ago I was graduating high school. This post is a breakdown of some things that have happened since then and the path I’ve chosen for myself. It is public for the world to see, but was written primarily for myself to reflect.</p>

<p>If you’re here reading, I hope you find some of these things interesting.</p>

<h4 id="june_2009">June 2009</h4>

<p>I graduated East Brunswick High School with a GPA somewhere around 2.2 if I recall correctly. I did well my freshman and sophomore year, and fell into a black hole junior and senior year.</p>

<h4 id="september_2009">September 2009</h4>

<p>I took a semester off from starting my college career and continued with my job delivering pizza that I’d had since the beginning of the year. There wasn’t much of a plan at the time. I wanted to be involved with film or video production or something along those lines.</p>

<h4 id="january_2010">January 2010</h4>

<p>I’d decided to go to school to major in English and began attending Middlesex County College. For half the semester I wondered what I was doing and questioned everything I did and everyone who told me I had to complete an assignment and do this and do that. The significance of any of the work never seemed apparent.</p>

<h4 id="march_2010">March 2010</h4>

<p>School wasn’t for me. I dropped out. Delivering pizza was still pretty good money giving me a couple hundred dollars each week.</p>

<h4 id="march_2010_to_september_2011">March 2010 to September 2011</h4>

<p>I continued delivering pizza for a year and a half. During this time I began picking up small random side jobs fixing computers. It was easy cash and didn’t take a ton of time. Somewhere in mid-2011 I got hired by Best Buy and worked for the Geek Squad part time. I quit delivering pizza and decided to try school again.</p>

<h4 id="september_2011">September 2011</h4>

<p>In September I began school at Middlesex County College again this time aiming for a Computer Science degree. I already had a small background in programming. I’d programmed in Java and PHP from about 13-16 years old for fun. I wasn’t sure it was what I wanted to do, but I did it. Java 1 was a really simple class focusing on basic logic problems. Most of my homework was finished in the same class it was assigned. I hated my other classes but reluctantly did the work, passed, and completed the semester in December.</p>

<h4 id="january_2012">January 2012</h4>

<p>My second semester as a Computer Science major! I took Java 2 and we learned all about algorithms from a less than enthusiastic professor. No emphasis was placed on use cases and it was pure theory. The work wasn’t difficult, but it was boring. I’m sure that’s how many non-hobby career developers might feel. The computer security class was taught by an ethical hacker at AT&amp;T. He was very theatrical and exciting to watch. He taught buffer overflows to a bunch of students who didn’t (and didn’t care to) even really know how memory works. Feeling outcasted by the lack of enthusiasm in the class room, I dropped out again. I felt I could teach myself whatever I wanted to know.</p>

<h4 id="january_2012_to_october_2012">January 2012 to October 2012</h4>

<p>Working at Geek Squad was pretty fun. There was an excessive amount of silly questions we would get from customers, but every so often there would be a fun challenging problem to solve. I taught myself to code better in my free time. I learned jQuery and dove into JavaScript (in that order). AJAX became my new favorite thing. PHP became a brother to me. Much of my time was spent building side projects and always putting myself out there. No time for shame or embarrassment.</p>

<h4 id="october_2012">October 2012</h4>

<p>I quit the Geek Squad after being offered a job in NYC maintaining web properties of a dance company. It was a great job to start with. I met a lot of wonderful people and learned quickly adapting to all tasks that were thrown at me. Some of it was difficult, but I like to think I picked up quickly. I stayed with the company for about 3 months.</p>

<h4 id="january_2013">January 2013</h4>

<p>In February I was approached by my current employer. They were hiring PHP developers and saw my profile on LinkedIn. It seemed like a really great place to work (turns out I was right about this), so I decided to go ahead and schedule a phone interview during one of my lunch breaks. An ed tech company located in downtown NYC. Sounded great! I passed the phone screen and went for an in person interview early in the morning one day before work. Everything went well, and I eventually received an offer. It was an incredible opportunity and I couldn’t possibly turn it down. My two weeks were in shortly afterwards.</p>

<h4 id="february_2013_to_current">February 2013 to Current</h4>

<p>I began my new job working with 4 other wonderful developers and things were (and currently are) great. I’ve worked on many fun projects from rebuilding the mobile website, to internal tools, to designing and creating an API and SDK.</p>

<p>The biggest thing I’ve learned in the past 4 years is that life is actually 100% what you make it. We have this incredible ability to steer our own future and take it wherever we want it to go.</p>

<p><strong>There are only more great things on the way and I look forward with open arms to the next 4 years of this journey.</strong></p>
