title: How to Speak to an Engineer
---

Engineers aren't better or smarter than you, but we do think and perceive words differently than you might intend. Sometimes we need help understanding what you're saying, not because you're saying it wrong, but because we require an immense amount of detail in our work and that tends to leak into our lives outside of the office.

###"Grab X from the supermarket"
An engineer will respond with the following questions:

- How much of X?
- What brand of X?
- Where is X in the supermarket?

 This is an attempt to make our visit to the store as quick and efficient as possible. Try to provide this information up front for **serious bonus points**.

###"Meet me at {place} at {time}"
If you think this sounds explicit enough, you're probably right. But when the clock hits {time} and you're no where to be found, I'm going to get a nervous tick pretty much instantly. 
>Am I in the wrong place? 
>Am I late/early?  
The solution is to just **keep us in the know**.

###"Can you build this app/website/product/idea?"
The answer will be "Yes." **Do not** confuse this with "Yes, I will."  We say what we mean, and usually not much more.

###"How will X idea make money?"
It won't.  We don't always care if something makes money.  **Sometimes seeing people using and enjoying things we've built is payment enough**.

###Summary
Be explicit and patient with us. We just want to understand fully what we're talking about.  Sometimes the reward for hard work is as simple as somebody using it.  We're analytical, detail-obsessed, and often a bit neurotic, but we try our best to mesh with those unlike ourselves anyway.  


For real though, don't be late to things. That's just plain **rude**.
