title: Don't Let Your Job Define You
---

Every time I go out somewhere and I meet a new person the conversation has a tendency to begin like this:

> Hey! I'm so-and-so.

> Cool, so-and-so, I'm Mark.  Tell me something about yourself.

> Sure! I'm a business-person at \[company\]. I do X with Y and make Z happen. Basically I \[little quip summarizing daily activities\].

That's cool and I'm 100% guilty of the same thing. You might be too. It's easy to define yourself by the work you do. Maybe when you spend 40+ hours a week with the same people doing a job, it's difficult not to.  **It's bullshit though.**

I love the work I do. I love the company I work for and I love the people I work with. And maybe I don't even mind being known as a software developer; it's a cool thing and I'm proud of everything I've done.  But, maybe you want to be known for a bit more. Something different and new.

Shouldn't we want to be known for what we do outside of work? Isn't that what makes us interesting and unique people?  I don't have the answers to these questions and I suspect you don't either since, you know, they're subjective and all.

But I think I'm going to introduce myself by what I do outside of work from now on.
