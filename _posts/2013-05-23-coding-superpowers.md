title: Coding Superpowers
---

The coolest thing about coding is how similar to a superpower it is.  It's a superpower that anybody can learn.  You don't need to be a math expert and you don't need any expensive tools to get started. It's also unbelievably gratifying when your skill set starts improving rapidly.  Eventually you get to the point where somebody will ask you "Hey, can we build this?" and the answer will always be yes, because there is virtually nothing you can't build with code.

In fact, it's kind of like in a movie where you'll see a flashback of something bad happening to the villain before he was a bad guy. Then you'll see him become more evil and stronger over time.  Learning to code is a lot like that, except (hopefully) you're using those powers for good.  Every milestone you reach is a huge victory, and the feeling is neverending because you'll never run out of things to learn.

The only tools you need to get started are a **computer** (any kind at all),  **text editor**, and a **web browser**. The internet has everything you'll ever need to learn an immense amount of superpowers.  Get started on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) and get your feet wet.  You'll start craving more. That's when you hit Google to learn how to grow your superpower to unimaginable ends!  You can quite literally search hings like "how do i put an image in a web page" or "intro to javascript" to learn anything.

There's always something to get excited about in web development since it moves so quickly.  You constantly have the opportunity to learn and achieve more than you ever though possible.  That's why I and so many others do what we do. 

We'll never reach the end of this tunnel, but I think that's the best part.
