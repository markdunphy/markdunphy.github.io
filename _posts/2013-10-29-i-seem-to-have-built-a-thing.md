title: I Seem to have Built a Thing
---

It seems as though I may have built a thing. It's called [Roomerly](http://roomer.ly) and you can go visit it right now if you'd like to. No, really, I insist. You can read this later.

Anyway, three months ago I was looking for roommates to move to NYC with. Having only attended a small amount of college as a commuter and otherwise living at home, I did not realize that Craigslist is really the only halfway decent place to look. I use the word "halfway" rather literally.  You need to sift through endless amounts of spam, unintelligible posts, and often times creepy people to find what you're looking for.  The roommates that I did manage to find are wonderful people and I'm happy I spent the time looking for them.

_Surely it could be easier!_

So I set out on a mission to build a website where you could make a profile and look for other, like-minded people in a straightforward and
easy to use way. I didn't do market research. I didn't care. I still don't. If I throw some money away on advertisements and after a year, this thing bombs, that's just fine with me.

I built it without caring where it went, or what happened. All I knew was that finding a roommate sucked and surely I wasn't the only person who would appreciate a cleaner way to do it. So I went for a ride.

Roomerly lets you create an account and get started right away. In fact, you can sign up, immediately edit your profile, and go live in under 2 minutes. Once you like how your profile looks, you can go straight to browsing for other people like you.  See somebody who looks interesting? Request to chat! They'll get a notification and, if they accept, you two lovely people can start chatting right there in real time to see if you click.

This is all _free_. That's right! A free service without advertisements. I've bootstrapped the hell out of it and am currently supporting all the server bills (there's 3!) out of pocket since this project means something to me and I want it to mean something to you too.

I'll be making another post soon about everything I've learned from building this thing.  I hope you'll check it out!
